# Config: UI Group `ui-group`

Each group is rendered within a `ui-page` as part of a [Layout](../../contributing/guides/layouts). Each layout will differ in how those groups are rendered, but fundamentally, a group is a collection of widgets, and generally has a label to categorise the contents of a single group.
