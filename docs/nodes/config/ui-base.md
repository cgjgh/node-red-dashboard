# Config: UI Base `ui-base`

Some details here about the ui-base config node

## Navigation Style Options <AddedIn version="1.2.0" />

### Collapsing (default)

/>

This open will shift the entire content of the Dashboard when opened, and not be visisble at all when closed.

### Fixed

Will always remain open. At our mobile breakdpoint (768px), this value is overriden, and an "Appear Over" option is used. Note that at mobile-scale (screen width less than 768px), then the Fixed layout will revert back to the "Default" option.

### Collapse to icons

Similar to "Collapsing" when opened, but when closed, the icons for each page still show.

/>

### Appear over content

    right="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-sidebar-closed.png"
/>

Not visible when closed, and when open, will appear over the Dashboard content, without shifting it.

### Always Hide

The sidebar will not be visible under any circumstances. All pages are still accesible via their direct links or a [ui-control](../widgets/ui-control.md) node.
