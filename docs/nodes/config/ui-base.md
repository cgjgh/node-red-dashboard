# Config: UI Base `ui-base`

## Properties

<PropsTable :hide-dynamic="true"/>

## Application Icon <AddedIn version="1.18.0" />

The **Application Icon** feature allows you to set a custom icon for your Node-RED Dashboard. This icon is used in the browser tab and when installing the dashboard as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). The image provided should be a square with dimensions between **192px and 512px**. To set it up, provide a URL to an image in the App Icon field, enhancing branding and user recognition.

#### To configure the Application Icon feature in Node-RED Dashboard 2.0, follow these steps:

1. Open the Edit ui-base node settings.
2. In the App Icon field, enter the URL of the image you want to use as your app icon. Ensure the image is square, with dimensions between 192px and 512px.
3. This icon will be displayed in the browser tab and when the dashboard is installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
4. Click Update to save the changes.

## Title Bar Style Options <AddedIn version="1.10.0" />

### Title Bar - Default

The title bar will appear as the first element, and scroll _with_ the content, meaning that on longer pages, the title bar will not be visible when the page is scrolled.

### Title Bar - Fixed

The title bar will _always_ be visible, even when the page is scrolled. This is useful for when you want to always have access to the title bar, regardless of the page's length.

### Title Bar - Hidden

The title bar is not visible at all. Note that it is still possible to see the navigation menu in this state by choosing the [Fixed](#fixed) option.

## Navigation Style Options <AddedIn version="1.2.0" />

### Navigation - Collapsing (default)

<SideBySideImages

    left="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-default-open.png"
    right="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-sidebar-closed.png"
/>

This open will shift the entire content of the Dashboard when opened, and not be visible at all when closed.

### Navigation - Fixed

Will always remain open. At our mobile breakpoint (768px), this value is overridden, and an "Appear Over" option is used. Note that at mobile-scale (screen width less than 768px), then the Fixed layout will revert back to the "Default" option.

### Navigation - Collapse to Icons

Similar to "Collapsing" when opened, but when closed, the icons for each page still show.

<SideBySideImages
    caption="Example of how the 'Collapsing' option looks when open (left) and closed (right)."
    left="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-default-open.png"
    right="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-icon-closed.png"
/>

### Navigation - Appear over Content

<SideBySideImages
    caption="Example of how the 'Collapsing' option looks when open (left) and closed (right)."
    left="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-over-open.png"
    right="/images/node-examples/ui-base-layout-sidebar-closed.png"
/>

Not visible when closed, and when open, will appear over the Dashboard content, without shifting it.

### Navigation - Always Hide

The sidebar will not be visible under any circumstances. All pages are still accessible via their direct links or a [ui-control](../widgets/ui-control.md) node.
